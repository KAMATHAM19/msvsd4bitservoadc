6. ALIGN tool

ALIGN is an open-source analogue circuit layout generator. The goal of ALIGN (Analog Layout, Intelligently Generated from Netlists) is to automatically translate an analogue circuit's unannotated (or partially annotated) SPICE netlist to a GDSII layout.
Prerequisites in the system are required for installation. 
`gcc >= 6.1.0` 
`python >= 3.7`

Use the following commands to install ALIGN tool

1.Setting the compiler paths 
```
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc
export CXX=/usr/bin/g++
```

2.Clone the ALIGN source code to your local environment
```
git clone https://github.com/ALIGN-analoglayout/ALIGN-public
cd ALIGN-public
```
3.Create a Python virtualenv
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.10-venv
python3 -m venv general
source general/bin/activate

4.Install ALIGN as a USER
```
pip install -v .
```
If the error message "boost not found" appears while running as user, install the necessary libraries `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev` and rerun the user command.

To avoid errors in the installation we required build wheels and setuptools for align and gdspy
for gdspy
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade setuptools

pip install setuptools wheel pybind11 scikit-build cmake ninja
ip install -v -e .[test] --no-build-isolation
pip install -v --no-build-isolation -e . --no-deps --install-option='-DBUILD_TESTING=ON'
```
Adapting ALIGN to Sky130 technology

## CMOS INVERTER

  A CMOS inverter is a type of digital circuit that converts a digital input signal from one state (e.g., 0 or 1) to its opposite state (e.g., 1 or 0). It is a fundamental component of digital electronics that is widely used in digital systems such as microprocessors, digital logic circuits, and digital-to-analog converters.

A CMOS inverter is typically made up of two complementary transistors, one p-type (pMOS) and one n-type (nMOS). The pMOS transistor pulls the output high, while the nMOS transistor pulls the output low. When the inverter's input is high (1), the nMOS transistor is turned on and the pMOS transistor is turned off, resulting in a low output. When the inverter's input is low (0), the pMOS transistor is turned on and the nMOS transistor is turned off, resulting in a high output.

One of the primary advantages of CMOS inverters is their low power consumption, as the transistors are only turned on when the input changes state, rather than constantly drawing current. Moreover, CMOS inverters are highly scalable and easily integrated into larger circuits, making them a popular choice for digital system design.    

## Creating Inverter Schematic using xschem
The schematic circuit is created by connecting components from the open_pdk library and performing dc analysis.

DC analysis would be used to create a Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC) curve for the circuit. It will sweep the value of Vin from high to low to determine how the circuit works with respect to different voltage levels in the input. When the simulation is run, the plot shown below is obtained.

Transient analysis of a circuit is the simulation of the circuit's electrical behaviour over time, specifically its response to changing input signals.
